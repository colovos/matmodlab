The Material Model Laboratory
#############################

The Material Model Laboratory (Matmodlab) is a single element material model
driver aimed at developers of constitutive routines targeted for deployment in
finite element codes.

This guide is separated into four main parts:

* Part 1: :ref:`intro_and_overview`
* Part 2: :ref:`model_create_and_execute`
* Part 3: :ref:`mat_index`
* Part 4: :ref:`test_index`

About This Guide
================

This guide serves as both a User's Guide and Application Programming Interface
(API) guide to Matmodlab. The guide assumes a working knowledge of the
computing languages Matmodlab is developed in, namely `Python
<https://www.python.org>`_ and `Fortran
<http://www.fortran.com/the-fortran-company-homepage/fortran-tutorials>`_. No
attempt to describe them is made. Online tutorials for each language are
readily available. Likewise, the target audience is assumed to have a basic
knowledge of continuum mechanics and familiarity with other finite element
codes. These concepts are also not described in detail.

Conventions Used in the Guide
-----------------------------

* Python objects are typeset in ``fixed point font``.

Matmodlab is an open source project licensed under the `MIT <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_ license.

Obtaining Matmodlab
===================

Latest Stable Version
---------------------

The latest stable version of Matmodlab can be installed via pip::

  pip install matmodlab

Source Code Repository
----------------------

Matmodlab is maintained with git. The source code can be obtained from `<https://github.com/tjfulle/matmodlab>`_

See :ref:`intro_install` for more installation details.

Acknowledgments
===============

Matmodlab is an outgrowth of the *MED* material driver developed by Dr. Rebecca Brannon `Rebecca Brannon's <http://www.mech.utah.edu/~brannon/>`_ and the *MMD* driver developed by Tom Pucik at Sandia National Labs.

The syntax and documentation have been greatly influenced by the authors' exposure and use of research codes at Sandia National Labs and other commercial finite element codes, notably `Abaqus <http://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/latest-release>`_.
