The Material Model Laboratory
#############################

The Material Model Laboratory (Matmodlab) is a single element material model
driver aimed at developers of constitutive routines targeted for deployment in
finite element codes.

This guide is separated into four main parts:

* Part 1: :ref:`intro_and_overview`
* Part 2: :ref:`model_create_and_execute`
* Part 3: :ref:`mat_index`
* Part 4: :ref:`rtest`

About This Guide
================

This guide serves as both a User's Guide and Application Programming Interface
(API) guide to Matmodlab. The guide assumes a working knowledge of the
computing languages Matmodlab is developed in, namely `Python
<https://www.python.org>`_ and `Fortran
<http://www.fortran.com/the-fortran-company-homepage/fortran-tutorials>`_. No
attempt to describe them is made. Online tutorials for each language are
readily available. Likewise, the target audience is assumed to have a basic
knowledge of continuum mechanics and familiarity with other finite element
codes. These concepts are also not described in detail.
