Step Types
==========

The following step types are implemented by the ``MaterialPointSimulator`` class:

* ``StrainStep``, all step components are interpreted as components of the strain tensor.

* ``StrainRateStep``, all step components are interpreted as components of the strain rate tensor.

* ``StressStep``, all step components are interpreted as components of the stress tensor.

* ``StressRateStep``, all step components are interpreted as components of the stress rate tensor.

* ``DisplacementStep``, all step components are interpreted as components of the displacement vector, applied only to the "+" faces of a unit cube centered at the coordinate origin.

* ``DefGradStep``, all step components are interpreted as components of the deformation gradient tensor.

* ``MixedStep``, all step components are interpreted as components of stress and/or strain.  Must supply the ``descriptors`` keyword to designate the interpretation of each component.
