Matmodlab Simulation Components
###############################

A *matmodlab* model is composed of several different components that together describe the conditions under which a material model is exercised.  At a minimum, a model consists of the following: a ``MaterialPointSimulator`` object, a material model and associated data, and a description of the analysis steps.  Optionally, material data can be permutated and the model run under different conditions by a ``Permutator`` object, parameters can be optimized by an ``Optimizer`` object, and the material can be exercised in conjunction with several add-on models.

Each of these components is described in the sections to follow.
